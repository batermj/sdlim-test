sdlim-test.c is a simple SDL program that prints in a window 
the character that was last pressed. It uses SDL_ttf for printing.
The purpose of this program is to help test the new Input Method
support in SDL.

The program is based on checkkeys.c (part of the test suite of SDL 1.3)
and showfont.c (part of SDL_ttf), by Sam Lantinga.
